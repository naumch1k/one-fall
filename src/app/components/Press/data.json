      "outline": "The Salem group was quick to shred the evening’s final competing set into epic snapshots: Pleather boots perched on monitors, sweaty locks of hair tossed back and snapped forward, concentration funneled into fast fingers skating across a golden Gibson. And good luck to anyone trying to take a photo whenever lead singer and guitarist Helen McWilliams punched a riotous fist in the air, causing a legion of North Shore devotees to follow suit right in front of every camera lens.",

      "outline": "One Fall is a Salem, MA punk rock supergroup. The band just released their debut three song EP, and to call it melodic hardcore is an understatement. Musically ‘Slingshot’, ‘Rats Abandon Ship’... fit squarely into the melodic hardcore genre. It's loud and hard like hardcore should be, but there is still a melodic element throughout the songs. It's not just fast and loud, but it's catchy as hell. And then there's the vocals. McWilliams has a voice not typically heard in music this loud. It's more of a pop style of vocal, but somehow One Fall make it work with the more aggressive music. Plus, there is some crazy great harmonizing going on here, the kind you'd normally hear with a band like The Beths than punk or hardcore.",

ONE FALL’s three-track EP, a polished hit machine recorded and mixed by Kyle Paradis, is a high-energy punk powderkeg that’s both brash and inviting, packing the type of infectious ragers that squat in your dome and refuse to vacate.",
